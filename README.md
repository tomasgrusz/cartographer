<h1>🏔️ Terren 🗺️</h1>

<h2>📋 Description</h2>

Terren is an open-source, browser-based voxel terrain map generator and 3D visualiser. 
Terren uses procedural generation using rules and noise maps to create visually pleasing voxel terrains. 
You can also import your own noise maps to generate unique terrains.
Easily configure your settings and view the resulting maps that create a final 3D render of terrain environment.

Export your creations as images, .glb models, or even json configurations for your further development. *(coming soon)*
