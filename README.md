<h1>🏔️ Terren 🗺️</h1>

Welcome to Terren, an innovative open-source project that empowers voxel terrain generation and visualization right from your browser. 🌍

<h2>📋 Description</h2>

Terren harnesses the power of procedural generation, combining rules and noise maps to craft unique voxel terrains. 
Whether you’re a seasoned developer, a creative enthusiast, or simply curious about the art of world-building, Terren provides a user-friendly platform to unleash your imagination.

With Terren, you’re not limited to pre-defined landscapes – import your own noise maps to generate terrains that reflect your vision.
